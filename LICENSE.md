## Statement of Intent

CardStack was created specifically to serve the neurodivergent community, particularly individuals with ADHD and ASD who struggle with traditional task management systems. 

While this software is released under the AGPL-3.0 license, the creator's explicit intention is that:

1. CardStack and all derivative works remain **freely available** to the neurodivergent community without financial barriers
2. The software not be used for **commercial purposes** or monetary gain
3. All improvements be **shared back** with the community to benefit all users
4. The primary focus remain on **accessibility and usability** for neurodivergent individuals

The choice of AGPL-3.0 ensures the code remains open while requiring all modifications to also be shared openly with the same freedoms. The creator strongly discourages any commercial exploitation of this software or its derivatives.

By using, modifying, or distributing CardStack, you acknowledge and respect this Statement of Intent.

This project welcomes voluntary donations to support continued development, but will always remain freely available regardless of financial contribution. Donations do not confer any ownership, special rights, or obligations on either party.
