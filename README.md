CardStack is a task management application specifically designed for people with ADHD and ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Unlike conventional to-do list apps, CardStack presents one task at a time as a full-screen card that demands attention and decision, with dismissed tasks circling back around for future consideration.

## Purpose

I created CardStack for myself as a person with ADHD and ASD who struggles with traditional task management systems. Standard to-do lists often lead to:

- Decision paralysis when faced with too many options
- "Out of sight, out of mind" forgetting of tasks not visually present
- Difficulty prioritizing what truly matters
- Poor completion rates due to overwhelming list views

CardStack addresses these challenges by focusing on a key neurodivergent-friendly concept: **reducing cognitive load by limiting choices while ensuring nothing important falls through the cracks**.

## Key Features

- **One Task at a Time**: Reduces decision paralysis and overwhelm
- **Visual Card Interface**: Leverages visual processing strengths common in neurodivergent individuals
- **Color-Coded Priorities**: Makes importance immediately visually apparent
- **Circular Task System**: Ensures dismissed tasks come back around (no permanent "out of sight, out of mind")
- **Snooze Function**: Acknowledges energy fluctuations and allows for intentional postponement
- **Simple, Bold Typography**: Reduces reading strain and increases focus
- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides satisfying physical response to task actions
- **Minimalist Design**: Reduces visual clutter and sensory overload
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Adapts to visual sensitivity preferences
- **PWA Support**: Install as a standalone app on mobile devices
- **Shuffle Feature**: Mix up your tasks when you need a fresh perspective

## Development Approach

CardStack was "vibe coded" using AI assistance (Claude by Anthropic) to rapidly prototype and refine the application based on my specific neurodivergent needs. This collaborative human-AI approach allowed for fast iteration while maintaining high-quality code.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion (for smooth animations)
- Styled Components (for styling)
- Vite (for build process)

## Contributing

Contributions to make CardStack better for the neurodivergent community are welcome! However, please note:

1. **Prior Notice**: Please open an issue discussing what you'd like to improve before submitting PRs
2. **Accessibility Focus**: All changes should maintain or improve accessibility for neurodivergent users
3. **Simplicity**: Maintain the app's focus on reducing cognitive load
4. **Testing**: Consider how changes impact users with various neurodivergent needs

## Usage License

CardStack is released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 with specific intentions for the neurodivergent community:

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! Future updates and refinements planned include:

- More customizable color themes for different sensory preferences
- Adjustable animation speeds (or disable for those with motion sensitivity)
- Optional sound effects with volume control
- Data visualization of task completion patterns
- Integration with calendar systems
- Improved offline functionality
- More customizable snooze intervals
- Enhanced task categorization options
