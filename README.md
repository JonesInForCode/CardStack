CardStack is a task management application specifically designed for people with ADHD and ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Unlike conventional to-do list apps, CardStack presents one task at a time as a full-screen card that demands attention and decision, with dismissed tasks circling back around for future consideration.

## Purpose

I created CardStack for myself as a person with ADHD and ASD who struggles with traditional task management systems. Standard to-do lists often lead to:

- Decision paralysis when faced with too many options
- "Out of sight, out of mind" forgetting of tasks not visually present
- Difficulty prioritizing what truly matters
- Poor completion rates due to overwhelming list views

CardStack addresses these challenges by focusing on a key neurodivergent-friendly concept: **reducing cognitive load by limiting choices while ensuring nothing important falls through the cracks**.

## Key Features

- **One Task at a Time**: Reduces decision paralysis and overwhelm
- **Visual Card Interface**: Leverages visual processing strengths common in neurodivergent individuals
- **Color-Coded Priorities**: Makes importance immediately visually apparent
- **Circular Task System**: Ensures dismissed tasks come back around (no permanent "out of sight, out of mind")
- **Snooze Function**: Acknowledges energy fluctuations and allows for intentional postponement
- **Simple, Bold Typography**: Reduces reading strain and increases focus
- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides satisfying physical response to task actions
- **Minimalist Design**: Reduces visual clutter and sensory overload
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Adapts to visual sensitivity preferences
- **PWA Support**: Install as a standalone app on mobile devices
- **Shuffle Feature**: Mix up your tasks when you need a fresh perspective
- **Subtasks (NEW)**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps

## Development Approach

This project was developed with assistance from AI coding tools. As the maintainer, I believe in transparent and responsible AI usage in software development.

### My AI-Assisted Development Process:

- I personally review, understand, and verify all AI-generated code before implementation
- All code undergoes security vulnerability scanning and testing regardless of its origin
- I maintain complete responsibility for the codebase functionality, security, and maintenance
- I believe AI should serve humanity's long-term well-being with human benefit at its foundation
- AI functions as an amplifier of human capabilities rather than a replacement for expertise

While AI helps me create solutions more efficiently, the architectural decisions, problem framing, and quality assurance remain firmly in human hands. I'm committed to producing reliable, secure, and well-engineered software regardless of which tools assist in the code creation process.

Questions about my development approach? Feel free to open an issue for discussion.

- Auto prioritization
- Auto breaktime notification
- Mobile app notifications
- Improved offline functionality
- More customizable snooze intervals
- Enhanced task categorization options
- Release to Android (maybe)
